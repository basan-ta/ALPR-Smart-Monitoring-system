# Wireframes

Low-fidelity wireframes for the redesigned UI are provided as SVGs:

- `dashboard.svg`: Overall dashboard layout with Live Map, Alerts, Vehicles, and Stats panels.
- `dataset.svg`: Dataset viewer layout with controls, vehicles table, sightings, and alerts tables.

These serve as implementation guides and can be iterated for higher fidelity as needed.
